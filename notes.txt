in BuildConfig.groovy add:
// http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19196442/dependencies-issue-with-spring-security-core-plugin
mavenRepo 'http://repo.spring.io/milestone'

compile ':spring-security-core:2.0-RC2'

execute:  grails compile

execute: s2-quickstart com.bluelobsterstudios User Role

add firstName, lastName to User class

add code to Bootstrap.groovy to create Roles, Users and UserRoles

create home controller

create public controller

update HomeController and PublicController with secured actions

** Not sure why it seems that the @Secured annotation is not working, so for me to secure
these I had to use the Config.groovy staticRules sections.

** I also had to add the dbconsole plugin path to get that plugin to be accessible

add to bottom of Config.groovy:
grails.plugin.springsecurity.successHandler.defaultTargetUrl = '/home'
